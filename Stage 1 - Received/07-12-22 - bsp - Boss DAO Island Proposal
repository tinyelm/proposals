Mahsa and her team to design and construct TDC's estate in the BossPlanet Metaverse! Mahsa is a master of architecture and a 3D softwares teacher with more than 10 years experience.

Think Mediterranean Sea.  The Thirsty Dow Crew want to be the Outdoor Recreation area for the Boss Planet Metaverse.
On the estate, we will have a pub/restaurant that provides a dispensary for energy with bar game/music, a large beach, a TDC Marina, vacation rentals, Islands to explore, Rug Museum ruins, etc.  From the TDC Marina, you will be able to launch your NFT boat or rent one from the marina.  The lake will provide an interactive recreational area where you can enjoy boating, skiing, fishing, parasailing, and racing.  Play to earn games will include fishing tournament and boat racing.

TDC Treasury will cover all expenses for the TDC estate, so this costs nothing for the DAO!
