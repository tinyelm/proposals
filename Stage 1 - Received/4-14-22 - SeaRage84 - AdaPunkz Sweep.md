I propose we use 5k ada of the DAO treasury to sweep AdaPunkz and their Metaverse Pass.

Proposal Details

AdaPunkz is a collection of 10k pixelated pfps as an homage to the Punkz that were launched on ETH.  In addition to the 10k original drop, they are minting 5k
MVP(Metaverse Passes) with only 137 passes left to mint.  The MVPs have multiple rarity tiers with various benefits(not disclosed) within the AdaPunkz Metaverse Estate 
for each tier.  It was confirmed on the AdaPunkz Spaces AMA (https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1BdGYwWRRLNxX) that they are planning on building Punkz HQ on a Pavia Estate
complete with a stage to host concerts and a record store.  They also confirmed that BCRC is gifting them an Estate on Boss Planet if they sell out their Punk VOXs 
which they should be able to do.  They haven't determined their plans for the Estate but it was mentioned doing something with gaming.  Example given was Punkz Paintball.

AdaPunkz is also its own DAO and is looking to diversify its community wallet with various investment ideas of its own, both on and off chain. There is a real desire
to build the AdaPunkz to be more than an NFT centered brand, bridging the digital and physical.

AdaPunkz FP currently is sitting at about 80 ada and mint price of the MVPs is 20 ada.  If we happen to miss mint for the MVPs, we can grab them on secondary, for
around 20 ada for base tier pass.  The Gold Tier passes are currently sitting at about 300 ada.  

I propose we buy up Punkz with 4k ada and then grab MVP passes from all tiers with the remaining 1k ada.  Once all MVP tiers are represented, use any remaining ada 
to mint additional MVP passes.
