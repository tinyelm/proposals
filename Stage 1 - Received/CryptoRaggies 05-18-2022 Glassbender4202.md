CryptoRaggies Proposal

I propose that we utilize 3-6k ada buying CryptoRaggies and then stake them on their website for passive income.

CryptoRaggies are NFT's for the play to earn game Raggie Run, this game is already up and running and we will be able to immediatly stake our Raggies on thier website
for passive income, again this is already up and running we do not have to wait at all!

When you stake your CryptoRaggie on the website free to play players who do not have an nft can use it and we get paid in Rag token which is already trading on Sundayswap
for 1ada=706RAG, and when we stake the NFT's do not leave our wallet and are not locked in a smart contract so we are still free to do what we want with them.

I suggest we vote to either continue to hold or sell 90 days after we buy or sooner if voted on by dao
