## Proposal Summary
**_What is PAVIA?_**

Pavia is the first metaverse on the Cardano blockchain and currently sits at 2nd place overall on the CNFT rankings for total volume(trailing Spacebudz by 1mill +/-). It is considered a blue chip project. Earlier this year they completed the third and final mint of all their land. There are now 100,000 total plots of land, there will be no future mints. Whats important about the NFT is not the PFP, but the coordinates of where the land is located on the map. Value is based on location location location! There are Single Plots which consist of a 1x1 square piece of land OR Estates, which are much more valuable as they represent a square of 9 pieces of land together. There will be homes, mansions, furniture, vehicles, and all types of assets you can purchase to customize your Pavia metaverse land. Including assets made by other projects, for example: Cybertruck by CardanoKidz (FYI: Pavia bought CardanoKidz)

**_Price history:_**
First and second land mint price was 45ADA back in late summer - fall of 2021. Floor then climbed from 45-600ADA in one month. Then continued till it reached 900 before the final mint in Feb 22. 
Final Pavia land mint price was 80ADA.
Pavia floor has been consistently at 290-350 for the past 3 months, holding steady. The all time high was 870-900 in January 2022. The main reason for the drop from all time high was the injection of land into the market with the third mint in February, adding 40,000 pieces of land to the existing 60,000.

**_PROPOSAL:_**
We propose the DAO allocate 30,000 ADA from the treasury to diversify into three asset classes of the Pavia metaverse: Single plots, Estates and Pavia tokens. 
<>Sweep the floor and purchase 40x Single plots @ 290-300 each = 12,000 ADA
<>Buy 2x Estates @ ~4.5-5k each (floor price) = 10,000 ADA
<>Buy 180,000 PAVIA Tokens @ current price of 0.044ada per token = 8,000 ADA

## Proposal Details
What will the Boss DAO do?
DAO will purchase 30,000 ADA worth of PAVIA assets.
Why should the Boss DAO do this? What does the DAO stand to gain?
Tremendous upside potential here. The DAO should do this to increase its ADA capital. Iâ€™d say 200-300+% profits (minimum) across the board in the next 10-12 months. The floor price of Pavia is bound to go back to 900+ from current level of 300 once we start going through the important milestones on their roadmap coming up. Pavia estates will explode in value as well. Pavia Token is trading at 0.045ada but it was trading at 0.089ada per token in early April, this too will recover to all time highs especially once you can start building/customizing your land giving the token more utilization.
How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Propose that we hold these assets to at least end of Q4 2022. At that point Pavia will be fully operational and very likely cross-blockchain compatible with other assets and metaverses like Sandbox, Decentraland, Boss Planet, etc.
Ideally, when should the vote on this proposal be held?
As soon as possible to take advantage of low floor prices before Q2-Q3 announcements are made.

TL;DR
The Boss DAO should buy 30,000 ADA worth of Single Plots, Estates and Pavia token. The Pavia assets should be held for long term. The PAVIA Metaverse is being developed extensively at the moment so buying now positions the DAO own a piece of this blue chip project and to take advantage of tremendous land value growth once the metaverse is operational.
