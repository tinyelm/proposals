**Proposal Summary**

In order to position ourselves in Metaverse as DAO, we need to acquire land to later build buildings for exposure and contact with our holders and new investors. Today we only have land on BossPlanet and in order for us to reach out to other groups and diversify towards BCRC, we also need to be available on PAVIA.

**Background**

In order for Boss DAO to succeed in establishing itself as the best investment DAO on Cardano, we need to constantly stay relevant and be available in the places where our holders and potential new investors gather. It is therefore important that BossDAO has offices in more Metaverse than just BossPlanet. Since our aim is also to diversify ourselves from being overexposed to the BCRC, this is also an important step to take. Boss DAO need to gain ground by proving itself available in Metaverse, it can be one of the most important channels to meet and find new investors.

**About Pavia**

Pavia is the first OG project on Cardano to start building on a Metaverse, the name is from the Italian city of Pavia, which was home to Gerolamo Cardano in the 1500s. The platform comprises several thousand land parcels held by a community of 21500 holders. Although the pace of development is difficult to assess, they have enough traction to be able to establish themselves as a top tier Metaverse on Cardano, some like to compare them with Decentraland. 
Pavia is still in its infancy and the exact layout of Pavia is yet to be generally available (apart from a basic map), it will have six distinct areas â€” land, sand, sea, deep sea, mountain, and forest scenes. Pavia will also have ready-to-use builders, marketplaces, scenes, and deployment tools that anyone can use, without special technical expertise. The team consists of 18 people with different backgrounds, most recently the recruitment was COO Paul who has worked with game launches such as Apex Legends.

**Proposal Details**

Under the current bear market, it is possible to buy an estate on Pavia for around 3000 - 3400 ADA, which is all time low, so it is a good opportunity to acquire it. 
There are currently two estates on the market for 3200 ADA per estate. They are located at the top of the left peninsula, near their launch pad which we do not yet know what function it will have. Once we have acquired an estate, we can also start planning the construction for Boss DAO's presence on Pavia.

**Why should Boss DAO be available on PAVIA?**

Expansion to a new location is unlikely to make sense unless the new location provides tangible advantages, here are the top benefits:
* Exposure - Boss DAO can establish as the first DAO with precenses in several of Cardano Metaverses.
* Investor/Market proximity - We want to be near to our holders and potential new investors.
* Community - We want our community to grow and that we can meet in more places than just Discord.
* Coloborations - We can offer partners more benefits by working with us.
* Event - We can hold many new forms of events in Metaverse, such as launch parties for new projects launched via the Boss DAO launchpad.

**Investment cost**

According to the proposal, there are now estates on the market for 3200 ADA. In the event that these are sold or new estates appear on the market, it is proposed that we should allow the proposal to have a certain margin and allow purchases up to 3500 ADA to buy an estate on PAVIA.
