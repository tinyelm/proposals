Clumsy Ghosts Proposal


Proposal Summary:

I propose the Boss DAO spend 5,000 ADA sweeping the floor of Clumsy Ghosts.
Furthermore, I propose the Boss DAO mint 1 Clumsy Valley Land Plot per Ghost owned upon the Clumsy
Valley Land Sale planned to take place in September of 2022. (Mint Price TBA, likely 30-40 ADA)



Proposal Details:

Clumsy Ghosts is an Original Cardano NFT Project that minted in October of 2021. The project’s main point
of emphasis is delivering new and innovative technology to the space while rewarding holders of the
Genesis Ghost Collection. The Clumsy Ghosts Team incorporated as the company Clumsy Studios.
Clumsy Studios has delivered already in 2 significant ways:

1. By being a first mover in SVG Based NFTs. An SVG is a Scalable Vector Graphic. It is a set of code
that uses vectors instead of pixels to render 2D and/or 3D images. These file formats, as opposed
to JPEGs or PNGs, are code based, meaning they are infinitely scalable and can re-render as a
viewer zooms in, meaning they support any screen size and any resolution. SVGs are also code,
meaning they have support for interactions and animations, both of which are present in the
Clumsy Ghosts collection.

2. By bringing Smart NFT Technology to Cardano. A Smart NFT can be defined as an NFT that has
APIs embedded in the NFT, mainly with the ability to take in Real-World Data in Real-Time and
adapt dynamically according to the data reception. No other project on Cardano has this
capability. Clumsy Ghosts is the first and only Smart NFT Project in the space. In the case of the
Genesis Ghosts collection, one of the NFT’s interactions is tied to an embedded API. When a
viewer double clicks on the eyes of a Clumsy Ghost, the NFT retrieves and displays the viewer’s
local time correctly. Clumsy Ghosts holders were also airdropped a Smart NFT called Ghostwatch
for free. The Ghostwatch Smart NFTs are SVG based NFTs with embedded APIs that track and
display the prices of top cryptocurrencies in real time and update automatically every 5 minutes
with the most recent price upon refresh. This type of NFT has never been done in the entire crypto
space, and it was airdropped to holders of Clumsy Ghosts for free, netting some holders sales of
up to 1500 ADA.


Both accomplishments from the Clumsy Studios prove their exceptional development capability and their
ability to innovate. The 2 Smart NFT collections so far have stood as Proof of Concepts for the Smart NFT
technology that will be present in the upcoming Utility Ecosystem called Clumsy Valley in which the
Genesis Ghosts will receive a massive increase in Utility including the opportunity to mint the space’s first
ever Smart NFT Land Plot Collection, use the Smart Land Plots and the Ghosts to farm rewards passively,
and use the farming rewards to craft new NFTs that can then be used in Clumsy Valley’s Turn-Based
Battling game.


Owning Clumsy Ghosts and Clumsy Valley Land Plots will allow users access to multiple major utility
applications in the future, on top of the innovation already described above.
Clumsy Valley


Farming:

Placing a Clumsy Ghost on a Valley Land Plot will begin yielding farming rewards. These farming rewards
are raw materials that can be used in The Valley such as wood, iron, gold, and other raw materials. The
holder of the ghost and land can farm the resources themselves, or for a more passive option can lease
the land to other Clumsy Ghosts holders and receive a percentage of the resources yielded by them.


Crafting:

The resources farmed from Land Plots can be refined and crafted into on-chain NFTs in the Clumsy Valley
Crafting Portal. The NFTs that users will be able to craft will be the new “PFP” Clumsy Ghosts collection
known currently as Clumsy Robots (name subject to change). These NFTs are what will be used in Battle.
The Genesis Clumsy Ghosts will act as Trainers in battle, commanding the Clumsy Robots in a Turn-based
game. Users can also use farming rewards to craft battle gear for their robots such as weapons, armor,
and potions. All of these NFTs can be used by the original holder in The Valley or sold on Secondary
Markets like JPG.Store for profit.


Battling:

Users can either use the NFTs they crafted from materials they farmed or buy Battle Robot NFTs and Battle
Gear NFTs on secondary markets like JPG.Store to participate in Clumsy Valley’s Play-To-Earn Turn-Based
Battling game. The mechanics for this game are mainly unreleased but will be present in the upcoming
Whitepaper, Date TBA. It is confirmed that the Genesis Ghosts will be required to participate in the Battles,
giving more Utility to Ghost holders. Battlers will earn loot from Battle victories that can be used to Craft
NFTs to continue using in the Valley or to be sold for profit on secondary markets. Users will also be able
to wager on battles for an additional chance at Play-To-Earn profits.


These 3 unique utility applications for Clumsy Ghosts and Clumsy Valley Land Plots holders can benefit
DAO Members in 3 different ways:

1. The DAO owns Ghosts and Land Plots that are all farming 24/7. Each week the DAO harvests the
materials, crafts new NFTs, and sells on secondary to players that need them for battling. Profits
from this get redistributed to DAO Members.

2. The DAO owns Ghosts and Land Plots and leases the Land to other Ghost holders to collect a share
of their yields passively. The DAO then utilizes their Clumsy Ghosts to craft the farmed resources
into new NFTs and sells on secondary to players that need them for battling. Profits from this get
redistributed to DAO Members.

3. The DAO uses Ghosts & Land to farm materials and craft Battle Robots and Battle Gear and collects
Loot from winning battles over time vs both other players and potentially NPC Bosses (NPC bosses
unconfirmed at the time of writing). Loot then gets Crafted into NFTs and sold on secondary to
players that need them to be used in the Valley. Profits from this get redistributed to DAO
Members


Play-To-Mint:

The Utility/Gaming Model Clumsy is building is not the conventional Play-To-Earn Model, it is instead a
Model that is new to space that they are calling Play-To-Mint. The idea behind this stemmed from the
major concerns with the standard NFT minting process. Typically, people send ADA to a Project and
receive a Random NFT in return. The sender can only hope they receive a rare NFT or an NFT that they
personally like. Clumsy Valley is the foundation for an ecosystem that will move away from this standard
minting process. After the Genesis Ghost Collection and the Valley Land Plot Collection, there will never
be random mints within the Clumsy Ecosystem again. All future Clumsy NFTs, including the Battle Robot
NFT Collection, will be Crafted in the Valley from materials that were farmed by holders. This means the
Robot Collection and all future collections will be fully customizable NFTs. Players who hold Ghosts and
Land are playing/participating in the Valley Ecosystem to Mint the NFTs of their choice, hence Play-ToMint.
It is not a typical Play-To-Earn because there isn’t a guarantee of earning. There is a guarantee of minting,
however. Clumsy Studios is giving holders the tools to mint new and fully custom NFTs that can be further
used in the Valley or sold on secondary for profit. The selling of NFTs for profit is independent of Clumsy
Studios because it will take place on other marketplaces like JPG.store, meaning Clumsy Studios has zero
risk in being deemed a security. Clumsy Studios plans to be a major player in the space for the long term,
including when regulations begin to hit NFTs. When the regulations come down, Clumsy Ghosts will be
safe.


Mobile Platform:

Clumsy Ghosts developers have years of experience in building Mobile Apps and the team recently
announced that Clumsy Valley will be a Mobile-Ready Play-To-Mint Ecosystem. Mobile Apps are
uncommon on Cardano currently so releasing an ecosystem on Mobile opens the door to massive value.
Mobile Games make up a majority of the gaming revenue worldwide, with passive/AFK type games like
Clash of Clans dominating the space. Because Clumsy is building an ecosystem that is both passive
(farming over time and crafting periodically) and active (turn-based battling) it is a perfect fit for mobile
gaming. Users will also have the option the use the Browser-Based Valley Platform. Until there are more
functional mobile wallets on Cardano, the Valley Mobile app will remain an Off-Chain interface for the
Valley, but that means users can still harvest materials and optimize their farming strategy on the go. As
mobile wallets release, Clumsy Studios plans to integrate on-chain aspects of the Valley within the app.
Until then, On-Chain Activity in the Valley will be done on the Browser-Based Platform
A Mobile Platform is also a great way of on-boarding users from outside the NFT Space, which is one of
Clumsy Studios’ long-term goals.


Charli3 Oracle Integration:

One of the most bullish signals for Clumsy Ghosts is their official partnership with Charli3, Cardano’s
decentralized Oracle. Charli3 carries a lot of respect in the space and is one of Cardano’s biggest players.
For this reason, they do not take partnerships lightly. Clumsy developers have worked with Charli3 during
Charli3’s earlier days, so both teams know each other very well. The official partnership was created
because both Clumsy Ghosts and Charli3 saw an enormous opportunity in integrating Oracle data feeds
directly within NFTs. The first ever NFT on Cardano with embedded Oracle Data Feeds will be Ghostwatch.
Charli3 has not finished their Oracle Price Feeds so this data source transition has not yet occurred, but
when they do have the Charli3 Oracle up and running, the first phase of the Clumsy/Charli3 Partnership
will go live. Clumsy Ghost holders can expect more Oracle Integration in Clumsy Valley NFTs as well. This
partnership is a major value proposition to investors as there is no other project on Cardano building
Smart NFTs like Clumsy.


Ghost Scan Augmented Reality Development:

Clumsy Ghosts has committed to innovating in the Augmented Reality Space with an App they call Ghost
Scan. Details on this remain very limited, but the idea is to initially allow holders of Ghostwatch to place
their Ghostwatch NFTs anywhere in the world in Augmented Reality, and for the Asset placement to be
verified on the Blockchain. So, if a user wants place their Ghostwatch Price Feed NFT on their bedroom
wall, they can do so via a Blockchain verified transaction and it will remain there forever, viewable via a
phone camera or VR Glasses on the Ghost Scan App. This initial AR application will grow into much more,
including integration in the Valley. Clumsy Studios plans to place Clumsy Valley Loot Boxes all over the
world in Augmented Reality and let users search their cities and towns for free Valley Loot. This is like the
technology behind Pokemon Go. More details on this aspect of Clumsy Studios will come sometime in the
future


Building Clumsy Ghosts as a Brand:

Clumsy Studios is also entering the branding and merchandizing space. They are working on opening an
eCommerce Platform for selling Clumsy Ghosts T-Shirts, hoodies, and more. They are also releasing
Clumsy Ghosts branded Tamagotchis and 1:1 Clumsy Ghost 3D Figurines that float in real life with the use
of magnets. They plan to pass a portion of the profits to Clumsy Ghosts holders via royalties.


Future Catalysts:

• Official Lite Paper Release

• New Website Launch – The new website will detail everything that was mentioned in this
proposal. A lot of this knowledge is currently unknown to many in the space.

• White Paper 1.0 Release

• Clumsy Ghosts Merch Store Launch

• Progress updates on Clumsy Valley

• Clumsy Valley Land Sale

• Clumsy Valley Launch



Conclusion:

Clumsy Ghosts has recently gotten some attention following the reveal of Clumsy Valley, but they are still
relatively unknown in the space. Investing in Clumsy Ghosts is investing in all the innovative technology
mentioned in this proposal. Clumsy Ghosts also has an active and dedicated community that has grown
organically over the last 7 months. Adding this NFT Collection to the Boss DAO Treasury will bring
extraordinary value to the DAO.
