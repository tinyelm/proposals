## Proposal Details
I propose the DAO buying a set of Cardano Summit 2021 NFTs. Policy ID 0ad7f7a3281ba7c832344eb267594899147709b708176bc1084979f1

7 NFTs are one set. These are the NFTs:

For all that participated at the Cardano Summit 2021 might be familiar with it. If you didn´t, here is the short history of these NFTs. 

Back in Summer 2021 there was the Cardano summit. During this multiple day event, participants could search the virtual area for this hidden NFTs. 
The summit was hosted by IOHK. The NFTs where given out by Virtua.com (known as TerraVirtua until the rebrand). Virtua.com is a NFT marketplace. Eventhough they where advertised at the summit they didn´t have any CNFTs in their portfolio. 
In April 2022 they started the minting process for the Cardano Summit NFTs on the Cardano Blockchain. Participants could mint their NFTs from this time on. 

End of history.

Today:

On June 18th Virtua announced Cardano Island. A metaverse. Yes, I know... again a metaverse, right?! But hear me out. Now comes a little copy and paste...

**What is Cardano Island?**

Located on Virtua Prime, Cardano Island is a metaverse base built for Cardano and its community. Cardano Island forms part of Virtua, a gamified metaverse, where you can play, interact with great brands, build, showcase, meet with friends, and much more.
Along with Cardano HQ, the island will also house Academy Centra, a hub of learning and education, along with 9,999 plots of land that are ready to be owned, lived in and enjoyed by its residents.
Everything in Cardano Island has a metagame element. Special resources you can mine from your land, NFTs with links to web 3 games, game characters you can bring to life and much more!

At this point I don´t want to paste more of the website Info. It is the usual advertisement speech for a metaverse. For more Information please Follow the link to Cardano Island. https://cardano.virtua.com/

Let´s skip the advertisement and look at the really interesting part. And that is this:

**The island will have headquarters for the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and other linked projects.**

Yes, that´s right. IOHK will be a part of Cardano Island. Meaning, Charles will be a part of Cardano Island. Also the Cardano Foundation will be part. I mean, what else could you wish for your metaverse on the Cardano Blockchain? 
It just cant get any better. O.K. time to calm those tits. 

Still there is no whitepaper and no roadmap since we are very early in the process. 

What does that have to do with the summit NFTs you ask? Good question.

Holding a set of the Cardano Summit NFTs gurants you priority land minting for the upcomming mint of Cardano Island. Plus other special percs for the metaverse. 
For more Information please check https://cardano.virtua.com/

**What will the DAO do?**
The DAO should buy and hold a set of the summit NFTs. At the time of writing this would be an investment of 577,50 ADA. 

Cardano Logo = 67 ADA

Beautiful butterflies = 69 ADA

Friendly sprites = 70 ADA

Magical bison = 71,5 ADA

Flying stingrays = 75 ADA

Gentle turtle = 95 ADA

Tree of life = 130 ADA

The NFTs should be used to have the chance for the priority land mint. Therefore it is necessary to wl on the Cardano Island HP after the NFTs are in the treassury wallet. 
Later on the NFTs can be used on the land to unlock certain features. 

On Cardano Island the DAO should build a HQ like in other metaverses too. It should be beneficial for the DAO to have a HQ on Cardano Island. 

**What´s the benefit for the DAO and the holders?**

Still there is no roadmap and no whitepaper. So it is not quite clear where it goes. But I think like in many metaverse projects we might just have to wait and see. Like I said, it should be beneficial for the DAO to secure a spot on Carano Island and build a HQ. 

**Costs**

Initial investment of round about 600 ADA plus the unknown amount for the land mint. I think the total investment will not be more 
than 1000 ADA. To my eyes this is a nobrainer. 

**When should the DAO buy the NFTs?**

ASAP. The price is very low. Market conditions are in the favor of buyers. 

**TL;DR**

The DAO should get 7 Cardano Summit NFTs to get priority to mint Cardano Island later on.
