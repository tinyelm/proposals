Proposal Summary

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 35,000 ADA (or what the community decides) of treasury funds to sweep the Space Pug Alpha (SPA) floor. 
When calculated based on the current floor and supply, a 35,000 ADA investment would yield over 100 SPA giving Supreme Whale status and discord role. 
Supreme Whale status affords the right to enhanced monthly passive income which is currently estimated to be 500 - 2,000 ADA (actual payout is dependent on total Supreme Whales as well as monthly profits). Supreme Whales will also have the WL opportunity to mint enough Vox Pugs for Vox Whale status which will also receive monthly passive income.

CEO & Founders: CNFT Adam | Co-Founder Ultimate Warrior

Team: Darkwater | DLB08 | Hews

Proposal Details

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 35,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Space Pugs Alpha floor. Doing so will immediately make the DAO eligible for passive income which pasys out monthly starting in July.
Space Pugs has a strong business model and value proposition.

Amazing and fully doxxed team. They had some complications at the start with one of their team members (which made the floor price plunge to 60ada) but they were able to come back stronger than ever. CNFT Adam stepped up and helped transition the project into something nobody would have expected. Now the floor price is 235 ADA and rising.

Passive income from all 3 projects (Alpha, Poker Club, & Vox)

Current Partnerships: 15 in the Space Pugs Poker Club

Amazing community with Internal & External Community Engagement Divisions.

Owning 100+ pugs will give the BossDAO the Supreme Whale status on the SPA discord which will give BossDAO 2 free mints for all future SPA projects as well as 5 extra WL spots for the Poker Club mint and 27 WL spots for the Vox mint.

Supreme Whale status allows BossDAO to receive a 25% Discount on all future SPA projects.

VIP for life, Early Access & sneak peeks before others to future Projects.

Amazing Art. They have brought in an additional team member called Hews (Cardano Cards Club). He is a top-ranked artist who is presently creating the art for the Space Pug Poker Collection.

Their second collection will have multiple uses, holding just one will give you access to our own Poker Platform which is a joint venture with Cardano Crocs Club. 

Future of Space Pugs

Project Intelligence Division - The Project Intelligence Division (PID) will provide Space Pugs with a system for collecting, managing, leveraging, and sharing project intelligence. The PID program will provide the ability to import project feeds from public and community sources. It will have the ability to leverage the project intelligence in existing detective controls.

Space Pugs Poker Club (Mints in July)

VOX Pugs (Mints in August-September)

Pug Pub - SPA owns at least 3 estates on Boss Planet and will be using them for a variety of things, one includes Pug Pub (more information on this later).

Longevity: Space Pugs Alpha is set up with longevity in mind, with profits coming in every month from our War Chest, this will keep increasing resulting in more profit for holders.

Space Pugs are already looking at multiple collections past the 3rd, which would provide Utility to the previous collections.

They will be one of the Top projects on Cardano without a doubt.

Holding their NFTs is a guaranteed white list into their next projects
