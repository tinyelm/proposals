Proposal Details

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Chains of War project's top 3000 rank NFT floor.

Chains of War facts:
1. P2E, MMORPG fps, Triple A Game project plan to run under UE5.
2. 1599 wallet owners, 654.8k volume on jpg.store
3. 10k Genesis Heroes NFT minted on 4/29/2022, 100% sold out
4. has completed foundation phase in roadmap, and are now in empowering phase (see whitepaper)
5. team are doxxed, highly skilled
6. superb high quality detail artwork (see jpg.stores for NFT)
7. storywriter skills produce high quality lores (see whitepaper page 8 to 20)
8. game assets are already developed some (see game trailer link)
9. game aimed not only for nft / blokchain users but also non blockchain users, a wide audience of gamers
10. tokenomics are great and in game economy mechanics are really good and well thought
11. great utilities for genesis nft holders both in game and non game

Chains of War - Genesis Heroes NFT, price appreciation will happen during:
1. first phase: mira token release & ICO (huge milestone)
2. second phase: mira airdrop 
3. third phase: mira staking rewards
4. fourth phase: mount NFT mint / airdrop
5. fifth phase: beta - alpha launch
5. sixth phase: D-day game launch
6. final phase: mass game adoption happens

Investing in Genesis Heroes NFTs should not only be rewarded by (re)sell value.
Therefore holding a Chains of War Hero NFT will be beneficial in various ways, among holding rewards.
By holding a Chains of War Hero NFT, we will be periodically airdropped Mira tokens as a reward. 
The distribution and share of Mira will be determined based on rarity stats of your Hero, making the most rare NFTs of the collection extra valuable. The Mira rewards will be distributed monthly. 

Holder of the Chains of War - Genesis Heroes NFT will receive MIRA token airdrops on Q3/Q4 2022 (see roadmap). 
These tokens will be the in-game currency and will likely appreciate in value as the game matures and grows in adoption and popularity.
Items are forged by resources, both items and resources are purchased using  MIRA token as in-game currency.
Mira has 1 billion fixed supply. 2% allocated for genesis holders airdrop. 
Calculation for 2% genesis holder airdrop = 2000 mira token per NFT, assumption of 1 token = 0.1 ADA, then 2000 MIRA = 200 ADA (comparison of COPI token of cornucopias that has supply of 3.84 billion token with current price arouond 0.2 ADA per token)

Summary of Chains of War - Genesis Heroes NFT holders benefit in related to MIRA token:
1. Mira airdrop for genesis holder (page 27 of whitepaper)
2. Mira passive staking reward monthly (page 27 and 31 of whitepaper)
3. Mira booster (P2E) (page 27, 34 & 40 to 45 of whitepaper)
4. Holders shares in the game marketplace transactions (page 36 of whitepaper)

Summary of Chains of War - Genesis Heroes NFT holders benefit in related to non MIRA token:
1. XP booster
2. airdrops, whitelisting priority
3. discount on NFT forge (dynamic NFT for game character, read page 32 whitepaper)
4. exclusive legendary items
5. playable character (different with the non genesis heroes for mass adoption)
6. governance (page 32 whitepaper)
7. future interoperability (page 33 whitepaper)

Up to 10,000 ADA will be used to buy the top 3000 rank lowest priced on jpeg.store. The purchased NFTs will be held until at least second phase (mira token airdrop for genesis NFT holder) price appreciation begins. 
At each point of phase, the DAO will vote on whether to sell or continue holding the assets and/or token.
