Proposal Summary

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 35,000 ADA (or what the community decides) of treasury funds to sweep the Space Pug Alpha (SPA) floor.

Reasons to invest include:

* Amazing community, plus i believe most boss cat owners know of the CEO (Ultimate Warrior) from the boss cat community.
* On the 23rd of May there will be an airdrop of 2500 pugs to the 5000 pug owners ( 50% chance of recieving a free pug per pug you own).
* Owning 100 pugs will give the BossDAO the Supreme Whale status on the SPA discord which will give BossDAO 2 free mints & 2 whitelists for all future SPA projects.
* Supreme Whale status allows BossDAO to recieve 25% Discount on all future SPA projects.
* VIP for life, Early Access & sneak peaks before others to future Projects. 
* The art is incredible.
* Amazing team, they had some complications at the start with one of there team members (which made the floor price plunge to 60ada), but were able to come back stonger then ever, now at the floor price of 288 ADA. But the new addition (Adam) has some big plans to come.

Future of Space pugs Alpha

* Pug Pub - SPA owns atleast 3 estates on Boss Planet and will be using them for a variety of things, one includes Pug Pub (more information on this later).
* VOX pug mint. 
* Longevity: Space Pugs Alpha is set up with longevity in mind, with profits coming in every month from our War Chest, this will keep increasing resulting in more profit for holders.
* There are quite a few undisclosed items in the works that have openly been discussed in spaces by Adam and also Louie from Those AMAs,they are forming a partnership with at least one IRL business that will be also paying holders, Asdam has spoken about this income being for the Fawn, Apricot and Silver roles.
* Pug Floor Fund - a wallet with funds (from 50% royalties of all secondary sales) in to be used to maintain the PFF Floor. Once we set the PFF floor we will maintain it by using funds inside the $PugFloorFund wallet, any pugs dropped beneath will be bought up by the $PugFloorFund wallet (currently at 9,003 ADA).
