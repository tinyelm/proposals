Online Identity: CNFTavern
Affiliation: Boss DAO 
Role: Boss DAO Member

Proposal Summary

I propose to use 2850 ADA from the treasury funds to sweep HappyTigersClub

Proposal Details

We would acquire Passive Income from the monthly royalties, we can get up to 100% monthly royalties. Also, soon we will be able tostake the tigers to receive $HTC token.
Top 333 tigers are getting 50% shares and holders of 25+ tigers gets another 50% shares. 
At this moment the floor price is 20 ADA and 275 assets until floor 35. If we use the proposed amount to sweep, with an average buy of 25 ADA, we would get 200 Tigers in the treasury.
FP for top 333 atm is 60 ADA and 22 assets until floor 125. I propose to get 20 tigers top 333 with an average buy of 80 ADA = 1600 ADA. 
The remaining of 1250 ADA we can sweep normal ranked tigers, at an average buy of 25 ADA we would have 50 estimated tigers.
With this strategy we are going to get 100% monthly royalties.
