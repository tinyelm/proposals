## Proposal Summary
I propose BossDAO invest 5k-10k ADA in DiscoSolaris. 

## Proposal Details
First a little background on Disco Solaris.  Project minted its 5777 NFT collection in early February 2022 and in the months since has sold over 3M in volume on 
secondary.  The project was highly coveted, essentially breaking NFTMaker ushering the Seaplane meme.  The project took this punch and turned it into a web based 
plane shooting game.  This makes sense given the dev teams 12 years in game development.  The project has a robust Discord with 12,242 members and Twitter at 14,700.  
Unique wallets holding Discos are sitting at 1875.  

What is Disco Solaris?
Disco Solaris is a story-driven 80s retrotopia on Cardano.  Its a decentralized 80s universe and community focused on collaborative world building.  And build they
have.  Since mint, the community has spun up various projects including the creation of their coin, Discoin, which was created by the first fractionalized NFT on Cardano.
The community pooled funds and bought the Charles Hoskinson tribute Disco for 125k ADA.  Discoin snapshot is in process as of writing this so we'll miss the token 
distribution. Additionally they have spun up a radio station, immersive worlds, newspapers, journals, all of this to creat the feel of the world they are building.  
They even have a musical artist, Amber VHS, who has put out 3 singles in an ode to 80s style.

What will BossDAO do?
-We will set aside 5-10k ADA to invest in Disco Solaris.  Before a vote on this proposal a poll should be issued to deteremine the level of exposure we'd be comfortable
with.  

What does the DAO stand to gain?
-Disco Solaris is a tight nit community lead project full of artistst and builders in the Cardano community.  Recently, RatsDAO wasn't able to pass a vote to include 
this project among their holdings, I'd like to see BossDAO get exposure to this project.  Disco has a strong following and is seen as a well respected project in the 
CNFT community.  I can see them have lasting value as the project and its community build out this 80's Discoverse.

How long will treasury funds be invested?
-I can see this project taking off the way Ape Society and Kongs have so a long term hold for the majority of the assets. That being said we could have a systematic sell
off as the project value increase to take profit.
