**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**


Chilled Kongs is a Cardano NFT project that minted on December 8th 2021 ** The founder and Lead artist Decard#9094 and his team are responsible for creating and developing 8,888 Chilled Kongs with over 170 traits varying in rarity. Although launching in a very unique fashion, by not providing a road map.  The team rolled out road map V1 as more of a guideline to how they were going to build out the more recently refined road map V2. You may view these both at https://chilledkongs.com. One of the most chill aspects of the Chilled Kongs project is how they have let the community organically grow not only the exposure to the project, but influence the nuts and bolts of road map V2.  With the help and guidance of the holders the Chilled Kongs have managed to become one of the most valued NFT projects on the Cardano Blockchain.  


*Road Map V1*

As stated in the above overview.  Road map version one was released as a guideline to how the Chilled Kongs would progress by community lead initiatives. In typical chilled fashion they kept this inaugural version of the road map very simple and focused on community growth and project exposure, donations and royalties from NFT sales and mints. This allowed the team to build out ideas for the large plans they had coming for Version two and gave the community a simple understanding of where their funds were being used until then.

*Road Map V2*

After much anticipation from teasers of magic mushrooms to mutate kongs and future collaborations with other prominent Cardano NFT projects Road Map V2 was released. The Chilled Kongs first announced that they would be collaborating with Boss Cat Rocket Club on 4/4/22 (BCRC confirmed this the following day).  This means they are working directly with BCRC to develop Vox Kongs to be used alongside Vox Cats, ADA Punkz and Lazy Lamas on BCRC’s massive metaverse project called Boss Planet!  (Later the Baby Alien Club was also added to this list). As you can see on their website [chilledkongs.com], the V2 map has a plethora of teasers and future possibilities included but not limited to: kong tokenomics, 3D kongs, giveaways, Kongs Garage, Live music events, CNFTCON booth, inter-chain collaborations, IRL partnerships, metaverse spaces and of course magic Kongs which will be explained below.



**Magic Kongs**

After announcing the partnership with BCRC and Boss Planet the Chilled Kongs team went to work on how the mushrooms will be rolled out and how these will be used to mutate kongs.  Below is a hilarious and to the point synopsis from JuanTelo | CK (a Chilled Kong community Mod) that explains how the mushrooms will roll out.(Slightly modified). The list describes the type of mushrooms, their rarity/supply levels and how they can be used to mutate a Kong.


*Chilled Kongs Mushroom drop Announcement 4/20/22:*

1. Every kong will be airdropped a mushroom for FREE. 1:1 mushroom for kong. 
2. 3 types of mushrooms: Cubensis, Azzies and Super Magic.
3. Cubensies will be the most common (around 40-60%).
4. Cubensies and Azzies will transform the kong based on his traits.
5. Super Magic will do whatever the f*&% the chain wants and will transform the kong into a ultra rare Magic mfer without caring about the OG traits. Majestic as f&*%!
6. Each OG Kong can suffer up to 3 transformations as long as you use different mushrooms.
7. Public mint of 4888 Magic kongs.
8. ransformations enabled only after the mint.
9. If every mushroom gets used, total supply of Magic Kongs is 8888 + 4888 = 13776. yeaaaah science!
10. No OG kong is harmed in the process, you still keep him or her.


**PROPOSAL**

I/WE would like to propose that the Boss DAO initiates 30,000 ADA in treasury funds to be used to sweep as many Chilled Kongs at an average floor price between 3000ada-3100ada (as of 5/20/22 assuming this floor price holds) before the upcoming announcement details on the requirements for Vox Kongs.  The Chilled Kongs team has teased the announcement the week of 5/16/22 reading, “keep eyes open in the coming weeks.” This will surely cause some floor fluctuations. Along with this announcement, the much anticipated Mushroom airdrop to all Kong holders is set to happen by the latest, end of Q2. Being as we are nearing the end of May, that leaves us with less than a month acquire kongs for the airdrop. By holding any number of kongs we will be able to double the kongs in the treasury if we wanted to, with free airdrops of mushrooms.  Mushrooms themselves will also be trade-able on secondary marketplaces, which means the DAO can facilitate another vote to purchase more rare mushrooms if we so choose to create super rare kongs.  The more rare the kong, the more valuable.  Once The Chilled Kongs release details on their tokenomics and Garage Jeep parts among other road map destinations listed above,  we will be able to earn valuable tokens that could have great uses on Boss Planet and be used for other perks with the continued roll out of road map V2.


**Final Statement**

Holders and community participants of kongs since the early days have had absolute 100% faith that the leadership team and community behind the project has what it takes to further their already successful NFT project. On 5/4/22 the Chilled Kongs reached a milestone of over 10 million in volume in sales.  This growth has not slowed down and was all lead by organic growth.  The floor hovered around a 1k average for a few weeks before a gigantic whale sale timed with the mushroom drop announcement on 4/20/22 saw the floor rocket over the next several days.  Now the floor holds at a solid 160%(approx) increase from that 1k benchmark and I/we don’t see it getting back to those levels again anytime soon. Although the price point doesn’t leave the DAO with as many assets as other projects might yield, the quality here out weighs the quantity.
