Proposal Summary

Sweep The Mandrillz
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10k ADA of treasury funds to purchase Mandrillz.  Of these funds I propose 5k be used for floor assets and 5k be used for top 1k assets.

Details

For those unacquainted with The Mandrillz, they are a collection of 8888 nfts with a funky, colorful style.  The collection was minted 3 months ago and recently surpassed
2M in total volume, a big accomplishment.  There are 3 aspects to a solid NFT project and the Drillz have this going for them, dev team, community and roadmap.  

They have a solid development team and artist behind the project.  They are engaged in their community and with other projects for collaborations.  

The Drillz are known for an active community which is one of the most important aspects to any NFT project.  They currently
have nearly 20k discord members, 2700 holders and 14k Twitter followers.

Their roadmap was a questionmark shortly after mint but this has come into clearer view since our initial vote in early April.  They have a robust roadmap with various
project catalysts and holder's perks. Below I've copied from one of their announcments.

*Holders perks: Every holder has access to landsales, the handmade Dioramas and if you are coin millionaire to a Fat Bank. Every holder can get interests. 
Higher ranks will have a better chance to mint a rare companion.

*Companion Drop: You have to hold (TBA) drillz and keep them unlisted for at least 3 epochs. We will TBA the date. Why? 
You can upgrade the value of a drill with a companion, you get higher coin interests and it gives you access to Lowriders, 3D Assets and Mansions. 
But: Only if you have workers you can build! 

*Drillz Token: The token is the payment system in the DrillzCity. You can buy Lowriders + parts, 3D Assets, mansions, NFT Dioramas with it - 
and if you are a millionaire even a FatBank. The collector roles have different interests - and you can pickup em up. Not every drill can be a
millionaire - but maybe you? In the first days of the token we throw a lot of coins over the fenceâ€¦

*Drillz Classes and Rankings
-The Uppers (1-1000)
-The Middles (1001-6887)
-The Workers (6888-8888)

With this information in mind, I think a modest investment of 10k ADA into The Drillz is a solid investment for the DAO.  5k would go towards finding good opportunities 
in the Middles or Worker ranks and another 5k be set aside to pick up a top 1k asset.  Current floor price is in the 400 ada range so if we invest in this range, we 
should be able to pick up around 10 lower ranking Drillz and anywhere between 1-3 top 1k depending on pricing.
