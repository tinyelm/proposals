Proposal Summary

I propose we use 10k ADA to acquire Smooth Yeti Mountain Club assets.  

Proposal Details

As part of first SYMC proposal, BossDAO aquired 28 Yetis and a VIP pass.  On 5/6, SYMC launched their Snowmobile parts which had a total of 3,354 parts
to make up 1118 total fully assembled Snowmobiles.  One of the benefits to the VIP pass was a free airdrop of one of these parts.  The DAO was airdropped a lower tier
design called Frozen Wasteland, and as part of the first proposal, will acquire the 2 remaining parts to this to create a fully assembled Snowmobile.

With 10k ADA, I propose we purchase 1 VIP pass, current prices are in the 3-4k ADA range.  With the remaining ADA I propose we acquire parts or fully assembled tier 3
Snowmobiles depending on the pricing. Sometimes it happens to be more cost effective to buy parts and assemble the Snowmobile.  Current prices for cheapest fully
assembled sleds is in the 800-1k ADA range.  The reason I propose a lower tier sled is for each fully assembled Snowmobile you get a piece of the royalties, plus 
when we decide to sell and take profit, these will be easier to move.
