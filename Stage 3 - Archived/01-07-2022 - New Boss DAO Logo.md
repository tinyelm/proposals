## Proposal Summary
To renew the BossDAO brand and create a new DAO-image and to distance ourselves from BCRC, we need to use a new logo. As our goal is to create a DAO-brand that will make a difference in the Cardano space and which will also remain in the future we need to take the brand to the next step. A new logo has been developed through a creative process where color choice and appearance have been tested until a final proposal now is displayed. 

## Background - The Creative Process

**The story of the logo**

Boss DAO strives to become one of the major established DAOs for today and in the future. And as a vision we want a brand that is viable and strong even in year 2085.
We believe that in the year 2085 gold isn't used any more. Companies donâ€™t want to be associated with gold, it lost its value and is seen to belong to an old economy. The logo must show a new direction a leap forward to the digital monetary world we are living in. 

**The Values of The Logo**

We want that our holders and future investors can feel trust in the brand and in the job that is done with its' treasury and future investments in new NFTs. The logo must therefore communicate through its' appearance our standards and ambitions. **Important values that the logo must communicate:** a) Trust b) Future c) Crypto d) Resistance

**The tagline**

Together with the logo, we wanted to use a tagline that creates a clear position where we strive for and want to achieve. It needed to be clear and simple and at the same time convey the same values as the logo. Our proposal was "A DAO for the future"

**Color selection**

Platinum metal has a resistance to corrosion the gradual destruction of metals, this choice of material would fit well with Boss DAO who will create generational wealth and overcoming world economic challenges over time.

## Creative Proposal


**Logo as image**

The logo is mixed with electro-influential appearance features along with a subtly used of the letters B and D woven together.

**Logo as text**

In the same way as the image logo, we want you to perceive Boss DAO when you read our name. So the same principles have been used in its development.
