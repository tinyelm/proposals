**AN OVERVIEW:**


**Lazy Llamas:**

Lazy Llamas is a Cardano NFT project that completed its mint at the end of December. **Our Founders Vinny, Sahaj and Dev team** are fully Doxxed! https://lazyllamas.io Lazy Llamas is an original project with original art. Our artist is one of the most talented in the CNFT space. Painstaking detail has gone into every traits. With a 4K resolution, our collection contains a host of details that can't be seen with the naked eyes. In fact many of our 1 of 1 Llamas have hidden codes to be found in them for the "Llama Mysteries" treasure hunts. Some of which are still not been solved till date!

Lazy Llamas is a collection of **5000 NFTs** that came with a random serum at an 80% average drop rate. This made a ratio of 5000 OG llamas to 4000 total supply of Serum-X. 


**Serum-X:**

**Total supply 4000**

Serum-X Tier 3 - 2000 Bio-mutant

Serum-X Tier 2 - 1500 Undead-mutant (the sneak peeks you're seeing now, Lab opening soon.)

Serum-X Tier 1 - 500 Robo-mutant

You can mutate an OG Llama in the lab with a Tier 3 serum currently to make a Bio-mutant Llama or make a Mystery Serum-X. A Mystery serum is a mix of T1, T2 and T3 Serum-X to create an ultimate and final lab mutation.

Thus, there will be 4 mutation types in total. 

Approximately 1100 T3 Serum-X have been burnt turning OG Llamas into Bio-mutants and were also used in Mystery Serum-X mixing. And nearly 150 of Tier 1 and 2 have been burnt to make mystery serum as well.

Approximate Serums remaining:

T3 Biomutant Serum-X - 883

T2 Undead Serum-X - 1350

T1 Robo Serum-X - 350

Mystery Serum-X - 150


**$Lazy Token:**

Total Supply of 500 Million

**$Lazy Token Schedule** 

10% of lazy token supply has already been Airdropped 

10% is reserved for Dev Team 

10% is reserved for Partnerships and Special Drops 

**Remaining 70%** will be Airdropped on a Periodic Basis 
 
$Lazy Token will be airdropped on the **15th of every month** (the snapshot will take place on the 15th earlier in the day) 

The amount of tokens each holder receive during the airdrop will be a direct function of the amount of Llamas he/she holds, the rarity of Llamas' traits, the mutants, lazy island plots and serums each holder holds. Finally, the mutants will get a multiplier for $lazy token airdrop (Mutan-llamas will receive more tokens compared to unmutated llama + a T3 serum).

Mutants holders besides receiving more $lazy token drops, will also gain early access to $lazy token utility perks which will be detailed in Lazy Paper 3.0 

What can you do with $lazy token? 


**Lazy Lore:**

$Lazy Token provides a customized experience and enable holders to craft their very own Lazy story. This feature not only creates a personalized narrative of their ntfs, the interactive functionality enables Llama Holders to craft a storyline about their unique Llama within the metadata.

Want to add a more personal feel to Llamas?

Using $Lazy Tokens, holders can individually tailor clothing accessories for the Llamas by adding their initials, thus making them unique of its own.


**$lazy Labels:**

Standard NFT naming conventions provide little to no connection and ownership of your digital asset. 

Lazy Labels is reshaping the Cardano landscape, allowing Llama holders to bypass the traditional number based naming convention and give custom names that fit their Llama. Names cannot be repeated for multiple Llamas (ie. if you name your Llama “Pacha” then no other Llamas can be named “Pacha”).


**Feeling Lucky:**

Lazy Tokens can be used to purchase a Lazy Lotto Ticket, granting the holder the rights to pull a random NFT from the Lazy Vault.


**Staking Lazily:**

Sit back and relax. We got this. By Staking your Llama NFTs, holders can earn more $Lazy tokens, reaping the benefits of $Lazy Tokens’s adoption and success. The Dapp connecting staking portal is currently under construction. This portal will allow you to stake your Llamas/mutants for $lazy token. It will give you a detailed analysis of your expected earnings broken down by their trait rarities and values.


**Lazy Dao:**

As we have reiterated time and time again, this is a community driven project! While the suggestions channel on our discord is a great way to hear community feedback, we believe that it is time to formalize this community driven approach. To make this a reality, we are transitioning our organization to a Lazy DAO. We want our holders to steer the future direction of Lazy Llamas by enabling them to use Lazy Token to vote on topics related to the development of the project and ecosystem.

Note: DEVELOPMENTS FOR LAZY DAO ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY, WE WILL BE UPDATING THE COMMUNITY AS OUR ENGINEERING TEAM MAKES FURTHER PROGRESS.


**Proposal:**

We'd like to propose Boss DAO utilizes 30,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the Lazy Llamas OG/ Mutants / Serums (T2, T1, Mystery) to maximize our exposure to the projects' upcoming developments. We believe we are still early in adopting this massive project. With so many huge developments to come, we believe the value of the project will continue to grow **exponentially**.

We'd want Lazy Llamas, Mutant Llamas, and lazy tokens to be the primary factor in increasing BoosDAO treasury value through free assets, boosted passive income via $Lazy token and the increasing value of the treasury NFTs themselves.

Prior to the T3 lab opening, we saw a big run up in value. For example, the Lazy Llamas floor rose from 200 to 500 ADA just prior to the least rare mutation lab, T3 (Bio-mutant Llamas), which opened on 27th Feb 2022. The T3 Serum floor rose from 200 ADA to 450 ADA during this time. T2 and T1 serum prices also experienced rapid price increase with its lower supply. This was an approximately **50%** and **100%** increase in price across Llamas and Serums. 

We recognize that treasury funds may be limited with its Treasury utlisation. As such we add the **provision** that if the Founders opinioned 30,000 ADA is too much for the existing treasury that all of the above will still be implemented but will be reduced in all proportions by 25-50%. Reducing the total funding to 5000-7500 ADA for each OG Llamas, Serum-X and Mutants. Chosen specifics within each category will also be decided at the founders' discretion.

**Proposal Details:**

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000** ada to sweep OG Llamas for upcoming mutation of T2 and future mutation of T1 and Mystery serums. Mutant Llamas will earn more passive income via the $lazy token airdrop on the 15th of every month.

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000** ada to sweep Biomutant Llamas as they are undervalued now. At the time of T3 mutation, floor of OG Llama's were close to 500 ada, T3 serum floor was at 450 ada, mint requires 40 ada, total value at 990 ada. The current floor price of mutant llama is only 500 ada and is grossly undervalued.

Boss DAO shall utilise **10,000** ada to sweep Serum-X (T2, T1 and Mystery). Currently Boss DAO only owns T3 serums, for future mutation, other tiers of serums are required. Since T2, T1 and Mystery serums are higher tier serums, they would collect more airdrop of $lazy token. Current T2 Senak peaks have been very well-received and hyped by many holders as well as newcomers.

$Lazy token **Airdrops** occur on the 15th of every month. All OG llamas will receive 5000 $lazy and Mutants 12500 $lazy. Future mutations for T2, T1 and Serum-X will earn even more! Currently $lazy token is available for trade at MuesliSwap and Sundaeswap. Current trade value at 0.0025 ada per $lazy. Prices fluctuate depending on bid/offer.

Potentially each OG llama receives 12.5 ada worth of $lazy token every month (5000 $lazy x 0.0025). Mutants receive 31.25 ada worth of $lazy token (12,500 x 0.0025)

Currently Boss DAO treasury has 265,253 $lazy token which translates to 663 ada with just 1 month of holding the Lazy Llamas assets.

Once Utility of $Lazy Token has been fully implemented, which will be detailed in upcoming **Lazy Paper 3.0**, we expect the value of $Lazy Toekn to appreciate further. $Lazy tokens will have many uses. You will be able to spend them to change your Llamas metadata, name your Llama, buy NFTs and other Merch goods from the Vault and also be used in project governance. $Lazy tokens will have up to a 50% burn rate when spent! (Details to be confirmed in Lazy Paper 3.0) Holders of Boss DAO will see substantial passive income from these holdings.


**Engagement:**

To enjoy our Lazy Llama holdings, we could even participate in naming our treasury Llamas! We could hold contests, games or an essay writing contest for their favorite treasury Llamas back story etc, in our server where winners would be selected to name a Llama in the treasury. We could then offer a PoP award for it as well. Just a fun idea. Using some of our $lazy token to name Llamas could be considered supported if this proposal passes but be implimented at the founders descretion.

**Statement:**

We believe the Lazy Llamas project is just getting started. Many New hires are on boarded the Team for Buisness Growth/ Expansion strategies and front-end Web development. This will help Lazy Llamas reach its ambitious goals to be one of the biggest NFT projects. The Team is devloping a strategy to be included in many metaverses while developing our own metaverse. Lazy Llamas and **Ada Realm** have entered in to a partnership to build out our metaverse by **Actum Games**, a studio of 10 developers, to build our metaverse, **Lazy Island**. We have left this aspect of investment out of the proposal intentionally as we would like to see more organic growth and adoption take place as game studio developments are provided to the community. We will put forward a proposal on Lazy Island Metaverse lands at a later date. As the project builds out, we will continue to look at and explore real world partnerships and NFT project collaborations. 

Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to a landslide Vote
