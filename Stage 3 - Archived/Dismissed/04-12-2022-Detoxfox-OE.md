I am afraid I didnÂ´t make it clear what a blue chip Over Exposed is. This is my second attempt to make this clear. 

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes up to 10,000 Ada to purchase 5 **Mekanism Genesis - Over Exposed** (Genesis Token). + Additional 500 Ada for the upcoming Mekanism mint. The floor price at the time of writing the proposal is 1,650 Ada for one token. 

Over Exposed is a digital artwork collection (NFTs) solely on the Cardano blockchain. The Genesis token for Over Exposed is a digital membership. The total membership size for Genesis is 1,000 tokens. **1,000** Genesis Token holders are eligible to mint the **Mekanism collection** 1:1 via pre-sale. The total collection size for "Mekanism" is 4,000 NFTs . The Genesis supply won't surpass 1,000. There is no whitelist for public sale. If all Genesis token members mint their 1:1 only **3,000 supply** will be available for **public mint.**

To be eligible to mint the Mekanism collection, token holders must verify their token on OE discord to obtain the 35mm role. This said, the Boss DAO would have to register on the OE discord to verify the token and the user for the 35mm role. 

The Genesis token should stay in the Boss DAO treasury for the long term. So the Boss DAO would hold the 35mm role on OE and will be eligible to participate on any upcoming mints of the project. 

The Mekanism NFTs should be held in the Boss DAO treasury at least for a year. After that timeframe the DAO members should vote on the ongoing keeping or selling of the NFTs. 

OE is bringing super high quality art to the CNFT space like never seen before. The artist behind the project is Wren Ellis. Check links down below for team and artist. I think this kind of art will be much appreciated in the CNFT space since it is unique, new and state of the art. 

Ideally, the vote should be held asap. The deadline for wl wallet submission/snapshot is April 20th. The supply for the Genesis token is very low. At time of writing there are only 39 token at jpg.store available. 

Why should the DAO get into Over Exposed? 
The DAO should get their hands on the token because of the upcoming mint of the Mekanism NFT series. These NFTs are some of the best art pieces I have seen all over the NFT space. But not only should the DAO hold the Genesis token bcause of this mint, but because of many other benefits to come. The darkpaper will be released after the mint of the Mekanism NFTs. The team is doxed. They are more than commited to the community and to the project. The member count on discord is climbing every day. At the time of writing there are 18.1k members on the OE discord.

**TL;DR**
The Boss DAO should buy 5 Genesis Token to get on the whitelist of the Mekanism mint. The Genesis token should be held for long term. Mekanism NFTs should be traded or held after a 12 month cliff. One or more members should be watching the project and the upcoming mints and inform the Boss DAO members on a monthly basis.
