## Proposal Summary
Proposal;

I propose we invest 30,000 ADA into the most profitable floor deadpxlz by trait. We can use the community made trait calculator for this.

Furthermore, I propose the DAO payout Boss DAO holders with the royalties from the genesis pxlz once per quarter (as to maximize the benefits for our long term holders the most).

The payout structure would be ammended into the proposal once we know the exact launch date of the PXL Forge.

## Proposal Details

Deadpxlz are a p2e game that will employ the use of a Pxl Forge and reward the holders of genesis pxlz, as well as a PvP game.They also have mintable metapxl NFTs which can add value of 4.4x per mint (62 ADA mint price, 276 floor).The use of the metapxlz is yet to be announced beyond metaverse compatability. 

Genesis pxlz holders are rewarded based on their trait combination with ADA directly into the wallet holding the pxlz.The Boss DAO stands to gain a significant amount of royalties per year as well as the ability to mint genesis pxlz, which will immediately add to the value of the treasury.1 deadpxl = 1 metapxl. 

Currently, each deadpxl has a return of thousands of ADA / year. If we accumulate enough, that will be a significant amount of passive income for the treasury to use for proposals as well as payouts for members.
