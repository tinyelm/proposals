## Proposal Summary
We have roughly 133k ADA at our disposal for our first round of non-BCRC related investment in our newly established DAO Treasury.  This proposal is to address 
these funds so as to not use up all of our liquid assets for investment opporutnities that come along.

## Proposal Details
The DAO Treasury has substantial assets at its disoposal BUT those assets will go fast with all of our prososals for investment so before we start investing 
I think it would be smart, as a community, to set aside a portion of this initial 133k ADA, for future opportunities.  My proposal is to set aside 20% of our 
ADA as an opportunity fund just incase we have an amazing opportunity between mints/royalties begin to really stack up.  20% of 133k is 26.6 but I would be 
satisfied cutting this off at 25k ADA which should be sufficient.  We can always stake the ADA not being used to generate income for the DAO as well.  If we 
moved forward with this proposal, this would leave the DAO with 108k ADA for us to deploy immediately after our initial vote.
