on behalf of the MUC.xyz organizers

## Proposal Summary

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes a to be defined amount of ADA of treasury funds to be promoted at the DAO panel of the [MUC.xyz](http://muc.xyz/), one of Germany’s first ever NFT events.

## What is MUC.xyz?

[MUC.xyz](http://muc.xyz/) is a two-day in-person NFT event, which is scheduled for 27th & 28th of May 2022 in Munich, Germany.
Goal of the event is to offer a platform to a broader audience to empower, educate and onboard the interested public onto the NFT space.

### event in detail

The event will be hosted in Munich but will collaborate with a hackathon in Nuremberg. This way we ensure an inter-regional promotion of NFTs in the two biggest Cities of Bavaria. 
The first day introduces the underlying technologies of NFTs such as blockchain and smart contracts. Different areas of application of NFTs and their economic significance will be presented using successful examples from the gaming, fashion and art sectors. A panel discussion will be held to critically examine the technology and its benefits and to take a visionary look into the future of NFTs. On this day, the audience will be introduced to the world of NFTs and informed about the basics and possible areas of application.
The second day will be a deep dive into current topics and trends in Web3 and the world of NFTs. Representatives from Web3 projects and companies will present their NFT journey, current strategies and experiences. Trends, technological developments, as well as tax and regulatory aspects will be covered. The crypto and NFT communities and all interested parties are invited to exchange ideas in an interdisciplinary manner on this day.

### event location and schedule

we are planning to have the event in the Haus der Kunst (House of Art) which is a non-collecting modern and contemporary art museum in Munich.

### schedule

#### DAY 1 for the public

- 0900-1000 Reception
- 1000-1030 Welcome Speeches
- 1030-1200 Around the block (covering the basics)
- 1200-1330 Lunch
- 1330-1630 what about NFTs

#### DAY 2 deep dive

- Anchor talks mixed with a ‘call for topics’ on twitter
- Web3 (metaverse, licensing, DAO, security)
- NFT quo vadis (gaming, fashion, food, art, tax EU, regulation)

### satellite events

- NFT exhibitions
- hackathon
- afterparty
- cultural education for Munich visitors

### budget and next steps

1. Finishing the homepage [MUC.xyz](http://muc.xyz/)

2. Signing the lease for the event location

3. Promoting the event

To provide an overview and a sense of the sizing of this project to reduce uncertainty:

A full planned event will cost around 100k EUR (~111k USD).

We are trying to cover costs completely through sponsorships and donations.

We are in talks with the Bavarian government for supporting us and chances are in our favour that a gov representative will do one opening speech (same for the city of Munich).

## Proposal Details and added Value for Boss DAO

On the second day, the MUC.xyz will cover the topic of DAOs as they are becoming the democratic structure of future organisations. 

We want to show the already existing diversity, complexity and enormous potential of DAOs.

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes a to be defined amount of ADA from the treasury funds to be promoted at the DAO panel/session of the [MUC.xyz](http://muc.xyz/) or on a dedicated LCD display.

Not only for the Boss DAO this an excellent chance to increase its popularity but also for the whole cardano ecosystem and the CNFT space to get promoted.

Ideally, the vote could be held until the end of april 2022.
