Various other BCRC, OG Bear and Boss DAO members contributed ideas

## Proposal Summary
We propose the Boss DAO  utilizes upto 8,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the OG Bears floor of bears priced at or below 100 ADA, currently 74 NFTs that fit that description. 
The first wave of functioning games and metaverse homes are releasing soon. The floor had reached 170 ADA, right before the 2nd wave mint. 
This current development lull is a perfect time to invest for a short-term hold and some passive earnings. 

## Proposal Details
The Boss DAO will buy OG Bear NFTs across market places on the cardano chain, increasing the scarcity prior to the launch of Homes and Mini-games.
Given the floor has already been 215% higher, the potential gains once that floor is reached and surpassed in the coming weeks is significant.
The treasury will buy, hold and resell the OG Bear NFTs. Spending just under an estimated 7400 ADA. 
The treasury will sell round 1 of OG Bear NFTs when the floor reaches its prior ATH to recoup expense and gain 2x profit. 
Additional rounds are decided by the DAO 
OG Bear NFTs with passive income traits earn in-game currency, Salmon, OG Bear NFTs with those traits that are sweep can be held back for long-term holds as ADA streams of income. 
OGB Salmon Trophies earn in-game salmon currency as well, the amount remaining from the 8,000 ADA can be used to sweep Salmon Throphy NFTs, there is only 2100, fixed supply.
Ideally, this vote would happen by 03-25-2022 +- a couple of days as more and more previews of the OGverse are being released. 
Additionally, there are airdrops coming soon. Game currency tokens, baby bear NFTs, land, and or more are possibilities, creating additional value for the treasury.

The mint sold out under a half hour with 3 NFT per transaction limit. 

## Closing
In closing, this would give Boss DAO exposure to a well developed whitepaper, with a large scale, collabrative metaverse that has early P2E mini games. A great time to hit an early project for the Boss DOA
