**Proposal Summary**
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes $9.5K ADA of treasury funds to sweep the VeggieMates floor in order to invest before their token $Greens and season 2 collection drops. No date for the drops have been announced yet but will soon so it's better to snatch them now at a discount price before the team reveals dates.

**Proposal Details**

CLASSIFIED INTEL. DO NOT SHARE. Only for the DAO: I was able to strike a deal with the VeggieMates team on buying a bundle of 50 NFTs for the price of 65 ada each (Floor did rise to the 90's and 100's since I proposed this) AND we also have to sweep 50 veggies off the floor on the secondary market. That is the deal. It will take roughly $9.5k ada. 

• The primary use of $Greens will be to fuel the Virtually Made entertainment ecosystem (The brand behind the whole veggiemates project), this ecosystem is going to be the "Adult Swim" network of the Cardano community. 

• $Greens will be the game currency in the VeggieMates vs. Junkies game which is a P2E game launching soon.
Junkies is the season 2 NFT collection that features junk food only i.e. french fries, burgers, pizza, etc.

• The concept and art is exceptional IMO, quality artwork, some with fun and intense images of fuck you's/flipping fingers and such. Not to mention, for each veggie you own you can mint one junky NFT (Season2). Artist Robotlim has been drawing for 30 years.

• The community is solid, and the team are very active in the CNFT community, they do events on discord and twitter on a regular basis, they host and join twitter spaces on the regular doing collabs with many other cool projects.

• The team is composed of business, crypto, marketing and business professionals with influence in the space. Among them, Paul Thomas a.k.a. Big PT from Good Charlotte is the chief blockchain consultant and Brian Stivers a.k.a. Beastives is the leader of the project and also has real world business experience, he is currently the senior manager of solutions engineering at the company DocuSign. Links at the end of the proposal to read about the rest of the team.

It would be smart to take advantage of this deal with VG and sweep the floor of this undervalued project now before the team releases the dates for when they are launching their $Greens token and Season 2 Junkies collection and P2E game (Which it will happen any day now!). Not to mention the floor is in the 70's (Now 90's, still good point of entry)

• Token staking, NFT staking and P2E game in the horizon. 

I highly recommend you read through both of their whitepapers before you cast your vote. The links are below.
