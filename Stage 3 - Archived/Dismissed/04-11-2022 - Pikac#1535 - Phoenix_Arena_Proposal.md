## Proposal Summary
We propose Boss DAO spends 10,000 ADA in the secondary market/minting of early drops by Phoenix Arena (Phoenix Arena Christmas drop, Max by Phoenix Arena and Diver by Phoenix Arena) before the staking for their WARI tokens begins and before the P2E game is developed. 

## Proposal Details
Phoenix Arena has the potential to become a top tier P2E game in the Cardano ecosystem, (think Axie Infinity of Cardano), if they can deliver on their game concept. It is flying under the radar, at the moment, and thus there is large upside potential. Acquiring these NFTs early on provides Boss DAO holders with the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of the project. 

They have a game concept which is compelling yet simple allowing for a "light weight" game development effort. The core gameplay consists of players selecting a few characters for their team, selecting equipment and skills for those characters, and selecting an automated sequence of actions for the characters to execute before entering into battle with another team. The game will focus around the meta gameplay of winning matches; acquiring and leveling up the character and the character equipment and skills; and rising up the leaderboard. At its core, the game borrows key successful concepts from popular games such as Crash Arena Turbo Stars (C.A.T.S), Diablo 3 and Clash Royale, that have proven to drive user engagement.

The game design is light-weight such that a relatively "modest" investment of 500k USD, (modest in the sense of the game development world), should be sufficient to deliver a top-tier solution for the first version of the game. The initial NFT sales of Max, Diver and Fluffy should be able to provide this capital even at current ADA price levels. (Of course this can vary, but I would bet that all of us here think that it won't stay this low for very long). They have a strong community of long term holders who believe in the project and support the project in achieving their vision. For example, only 5% of Max's remain on the after market. The projects perceived credibility has grown with various new partnerships such as with Cardania (Diver Cardania items and RAD staking) and being on the JPG Store Launchpad. The user base is growing steadily and the upcoming drop may very well create an influx of new users. Max has already been disappearing rapidly off the after market over the weekend.

They game is compelling. It seems that they should be able to deliver on the game considering the game design and the finances. If they can deliver on the game, the project could become huge. 

**What does the DAO stand to gain?**
The DAO stands to gain by capitalizing on the price appreciation of the acquired NFTs and the $WARI token received through staking rewards. The earlier NFTs will reward early investors by having an extra staking weight compared to the upcoming drops. Staking will go live in Q2.

**How will the treasury be involved?**
The treasury will be involved by sweeping the floor of Max by Phoenix Arena drop and/or Santa Diver by Phoenix Arena and/or minting or buying Diver for 10k ADA. (But why not more)?  
      
**How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?**
It depends on how quickly the Boss DAO wants their investment returned with profit. If everything goes as planned, it would be possible to return the invested money as soon as staking for $WARI tokens begins as it is likely that interest and confidence in the project will rise from all sides of the CNFT space. As the floor price of Max drop is expected to increase, Boss DAO will be able to return the invested amount of ADA by selling only a portion of owned Max NFTs and leave the rest for staking or immediate or later profit. If, however, Boss DAO is willing to accept a long-term investment strategy, several months to a few years of holding may lead to significantly higher returns, if the P2E game gains traction and Cardano space keeps expanding. 

**When should the vote on this proposal be held?**
Soon. It would be advantageous to capitalize on the upcoming staking rewards before they begin. They are set to start in Q2 2022, and the announcement may literally come any day now. (I can foresee that they would make an announcement before the Diver drop as this would be beneficial for them from a marketing perspective)
