What will the Boss DAO do?


Why should the Boss DAO do this? 
The floor has been slowly gaining traction since October, consistent floor with the main team continuing progress for the game mechanics. Currently the floor has returned to mid October levels after recently rising in a 30% gain those support levels are quickly regained once any amount of life is brought back into the market. Breeding utilizes either two dinos or a dino and savior however dinos have limited breeding amounts while saviors are limitless. Dinos receive more tokens than saviors at 750 to 500. Dinos can be breed 6 times each breeding session requires more dino tokens driving the use of the coin higher as the game progresses.

What does the DAO stand to gain?
Breeding benefits: renting out nfts, token drops, gain in value. At time of writing the dao would receive 42 dinos and 84 saviors

How will the treasury be involved?
Treasury will be utilized for full funding, 12,000 ada

How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Until game release targeting q3

When should the vote on this proposal be held?
Within the next few weeks. Less urgent no impending drops.
