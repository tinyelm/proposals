## Proposal Details


I respectfully propose that the Boss DAO invest 10,000ADA in ThoseAMAs, an NFT project on the Cardano Blockchain, by purchasing assets from their Genesis Collection from secondary markets before their full metaverse utility is realized and the floor price rises. There are many other benefits the DAO could benefit from as well, including passive income from the earnings realized within the metaverse.

Less than 5% of their Genesis Collection is available on secondary markets. This is due to the fact that ThoseAMAs investors see the potential within the project and it's future plans and refuse to list their assets on secondary markets.

ThoseAMAs has 40+ plots of high quality land between both Pavia and Victoria VR.

The Pavia land includes an estate, waterfront property and two plots of land bordering seperate portals, which is key when advertising is concerned. The first thing a user will see upon entering through this portal is ThoseAMAs. The coordinates for some of the Pavia land is as follows:
* -176, -151 (Portal)
* 160, -161 (Portal)
* -194, -25 (Estate)
* -229, 34 (Close proximity to beach)
* -228, 34 (Close proximity to beach)

These Pavia coordinates are extremely profitable, especially those bordering portals. The first thing one will see when entering the Pavia platform through either of these two seperate portals will be ThoseAMAs. This land will be used to advertise the project itself or rented to other companies for their own advertisement. A percentage of any money received from these virtual land plots will be siphoned directly back to investors that hold a non fungible token from the ThoseAMAs Genesis Collection.

ThoseAMAs has also invested heavily in Victoria VR, the worlds first realistic metaverse platform with no restrictions regarding what can be built or done with virtual land. Victoria VR was recently represented at Virtuality's 'Enter The Metaverse' trade show in Paris and had nothing but rave reviews. Game footage will be released within days.

Victoria VR land can be used for the following:
* Utility buildings directly in the game (mines, warehouses, etc.)
* Buildings for presentation (shops/stores, showrooms, etc.)
* Private buildings (clubhouses, private enterprises, etc.)
* A port to another world, game, or virtual reality


Most land, including land aquired by ThoseAMAs, produces resources that are necessary if you wish to build within the world. These resources alone are a source of income. The resources mined can be sold to players that wish to build on their own land.

ThoseAMAs also has multiple business plans that will be under construction soon after the release of Victoria VR land in March of 2022. Again, the land ThoseAMAs has aquired has already been paid for and encompases all available Land Tiers. They have multiple businesses planned for construction in the city center (Tier 1) of Victoria VR. There will be a fee to access the services provided by ThoseAMAs within this metaverse, but holders of their Genesis Collection NFTs currently on the secondary markets will provide holders with free entrance and other heavy discounts.

Aside from the services the Boss DAO would receive within the metaverse for free from ThoseAMAs by purchasing these Genesis NFTs, they will also receive a passive income through these businesses. A percentage of earnings within the metaverse will be used to pay holders of the Genesis Collection a passive income, just as with the Pavia land.

The implementation of these metaverse plans and the benefits given to holders of the Genesis Collection will no doubt raise the floor price of these assets.

Holders of the ThoseAMAs Genesis Collection are also given the opportunity to receive access to a special Genesis-Holders-Only presale for all future ThoseAMAs NFT releases. As ThoseAMAs grows, so will the demand for their assets, so having VIP access to all their future drops will benefit the Boss DAO by giving them guaranteed access to these assets prior to the general public.

Obviously this vote should take place as soon as possible as the Victoria VR land is being released in the near future. Once the general public realizes the benefits inherent within the ThoseAMAs Genesis Collection, the floor price will begin to rise.
