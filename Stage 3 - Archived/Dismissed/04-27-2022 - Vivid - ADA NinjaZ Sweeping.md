## Proposal Summary

We propose the Boss DAO utilize 5,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the ADANinjaZ Aramar and ADANinjaZ Atsuko floor in amounts that are multiples of 15 of each clan. Boss DAO can vote to sell before token drop, or collect the token for the upcoming game.

## Proposal Details

Boss DAO will sweep sets of 15 from the ADANinjaZ Aramar clan and sets of 15 from the ADANinjaZ Atsuko collection up to 5,000 ADA.

ADANinjaZ is a multimedia entertainment company that has met every goal on their roadmap to date. Sold out two seasons of 8,888, community created music with over 100k plays, physical and digital NFT-L manga, and soon to reach 1M in secondary sales.

For every 15 held, one S3 Daisuke clan NFT will be airdropped to the wallet during S3 mint. Marketing will begin picking up heavily in the month of May, and more details about both the token drop and P2E game will be released during this time. For this reason, we believe the project to be a good prospect for members of Boss DAO. 

The treasury will use 5,000 ADA to sweep the cheapest available from both Aramar and Atsuko clan, and expect to hold until Daisuke clan drops at the end of May. This will allow the DAO to receive the S3 airdrops, at which time Boss DAO can vote to: sell, continue to hold for the burn(Supply reduction), or continue to hold for the token drop.   

Ideally, a vote regarding the sweep should happen before May marketing begins. A vote to sell, hold for burn, or hold for token drop should be held on June 1st.
