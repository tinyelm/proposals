## Proposal Summary
I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 5.500 ADA of treasury funds to ensure the quality of future proposals and to further streamline the evaluation process.

## Problem
Every year there will hopefully be several funding rounds with hundreds of proposals:

- Some of the proposals will be well structured and understandable, others won’t;
- Some of the ideas will be awesome, others will be useless;
- Some proposals will perfectly fit into the BOSS DAO philosophy, others won’t.

However, every week the proposals have to be evaluated as part of the approval process. This work to be done will cost the BOSS DAO a lot of time. An objective and comparable evaluation is difficult.

## Solution
To simplify the work to be done in the future I propose to streamline the BOSS DAO proposal process as follows:

1. Define a more standardised proposal structure to ensure quality;
2. Derive relevant selection criteria to decide whether an idea has potential and fit into the BOSS DAO philosophy or not;
3. Set-up a digital workflow to guide the applicants through the proposal process.

In this way, the evaluations become more objective and comparable. Furthermore, the values and goals of the BOSS DAO could be taken into account in a structured and transparent way.

## Deliverables
The BOSS DAO will get the following:

1. A **proposal template** that can be customised;
2. A **selection criteria catalogue** to down select from;
3. A demo of how the **digital workflow** can look like.

## Roadmap
- [t0] **BOSS DAO grant**
- [t0+2 week] **proposal template update**
- [t0+3 weeks] **selection criteria catalogue**
- [t0+4 weeks] **digital workflow demo**

Ideally, the vote would be held 4 weeks bevor the next funding round.
