Proposal Summary

There is a lack of a trusted auction house in CNFT space. Existing Discord/Web based Auction houses are project biased and not open to public. 
Boss DAO is in a unique position to provide a service as an Auction House.

Proposal Details

CNFT space has a serious lack of a Trusted Auction House. Most auction houses that are discord based have very low exposure and are biased towards certain projects.

Boss DAO has the distinction of being affiliated number of blue-chip projects including BCRC. These affiliations provide recognition to the DAO as a trusted 
organization in the CNFT Space. Boss DAO (henceforth known as BD) can utilize the reputation to create a Public Auction House.

Auction House could start as a separate discord channel without utilizing any funds from the treasury. DAO may have to recruit auctioneers and moderators for 
the operation of the Auction House.

Revenue will be generated through Listing Fees and the Auction House cut from each successful auction. A higher listing fee (Ex: ADA 25) will prevent low quality 
CNFTs being listed. BD can charge a higher auction house fee (Ex: 2% – 5%) based on its reputation and exposure level. 

This will be a revenue target driven venture with a decided operating budget and a revenue/profit target. DAO can decide on these targets once the proposal had 
been adapted. 

Auction House services can be integrated with the planned Boss Escrow Service to provide an end-to-end solution for listers and buyers.

Benefits/Opportunities

-	Little or no start-up cost from the treasury. 

-	DAO will have a constant revenue stream generated through the activities of the Auction House.
  (Example: 100 listings along will net 2,500 ADA to the treasury. If all 100 listings were sold for 2,000 ADA each treasury will gain 4,000 ADA with 2% AH fees) 

-	Can be integrated with the Road map of the project. 

-	Boss DAO can stand to gain as the preferred Auction House/Escrow service in the CNFT Space.

Threats

-	Bad actors and listing of stolen/hacked/scammed items can harm the reputation of the Boss DAO. 

-	Competition from established players (jpg.store, cnft.io etc).

-	Regulatory concerns that may arise in future on sale of securities.

This proposal will not require funds from the treasury. The vote could be held at any point.
