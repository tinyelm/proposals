##  Proposal Summary


I propose that the Boss DAO utilize under 2k ADA of the treasury to commission a restaurant for the DAO created by artist MahsakonariBCRC (I currently have a 15% discount, good for a month). As we know, we are going to need energy on Boss Planet which is obtained through various actions including eating and drinking. Why not have a restaurant that provides Boss DAO members with a discount on the energy they need while also being open to anyone and everyone else on Boss Planet? A restaurant would be a way to earn passive income for the DAO.

  


##  Proposal Details


With this grant funding the Boss DAO will put up the initial cost for commission of the building. MahsakonariBCRC will need a little over a month to build. I personally own all districts and would be willing to house and manage/run/maintain the establishment. Can give coordinates. 



A restaurant would be a way to earn passive income, through sales for the DAO and would also provide DAO members with a discount.   




The exact mathematical gain from such a project would be dependent upon the cost of the building and profits gained from patronage to the restaurant. Cost of food/drink and exact discount for Boss DAO members would be determined by the group.



The proposal is an initial investment in the property that we would not necessarily get the ADA back on immediately. That being said, the length of investment and potential profit for the treasury is indefinite. Until, when, or unless we sold the building, DAO members would be getting passive income and discounts over time. This is not the typical “let’s buy this NFT for resale” proposal. We can work to get official partnership with BCRC. The time is now to think outside the box and to the FUTURE of BOSS PLANET!



The ideal time to vote on this proposal is right after the mint closes, as my 15% discount will expire.
