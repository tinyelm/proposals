Section 1: Proposal Summary

1.1: We propose that Boss DAO should acquire 9 Mutant NFTs in order to enter into the Mutant DAO Staking as a Service program and the rest of their ecosystem. This would expedite the roadmap as well as provide Boss DAO with a on-chain and off-chain tool kit much quicker than imagined. Furthermore, it would expand the Boss DAO partnerships to another major Cardano NFT project and one with strong development capabilities that could benefit the DAO for years to come.
1.2: Mutant DAO toolkit will be available for us in early - mid August. This will allow them time to optimize their platform and for us to prepare in the best ways possible beforehand.

1.3
Mutant NFT Key Indicators :
# of  total assets: 16,031 (6k Crocs, 5k Mice, 5k Toads). This is not a fixed amount - there are hints at future mints. (Mutant Lab)
# of Unique Staked Wallets: 1,619
# of sales: 6,899
(All of this data was available on a single page on the service theyre offering, you would be able to find out everything about Boss DAO on a single page!)

Section 2: Proposal Details 

2.1: What will the Boss DAO do?

  2.1.1: The DAO will allocate ADA for 1x Mutant Croc, 1x Mutant Toad, and 7x Mutant Mice NFTs from the Mutant Labs Collections. This will grant us full access to their ecosystem of tools.

    2.2: Why should the Boss DAO do this? What does the DAO stand to gain? Include mathematical figures.

      2.2.1: The DAO should do this in order to stay on the cutting edge of on-chain developments as well as expedite our roadmap. Outsourcing this sort of technology for this low of an entry cost is a huge opportunity to save significant time + resources.

        2.2.2: The DAO will have access to the DAO tools and services being built by Mutant DAO. 
         These include: 
         1) A proven NFT Staking Service that comes equipped with a voting interface.  
         2) Full dashboard for our community, which includes: Unique # of Staked wallets, Total # of assets & # of sold assets, percentage of NFTs staked, Total Volume, ATH, Sale, floor price, token / ada reward for staking NFT, as well as a calender that details your payout days and other scheduled events.
         3) Full Customization to fit Boss DAO
         4) Essentially the entire backend they will offer - as this will be a life-time membership. We will grow with Mutant DAO and in the end we will have symbiotic relationship with them.

          2.2.3: Toolkits like this normally cost 20-40k USD (40-80kish ADA at current market conditions) and would take the team months to develop. Mutant DAO has done that & offered it as a holding bonus for their NFT. With the cost in mind (see next section for figures) the DAO will save thousands of dollars in development expense & countless hours of time spent.

2.3: How will the treasury be involved? How much will be spent? How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?

2.3.1: The Treasury will be involved in the allocation of ADA towards the adoption of the aforementioned applications. The amount spent aswell as vesting period is detailed below;

Marketplace Info 6/3/22
1x Mutant Croc FP: 243 ADA
1x Mutant Toad FP: 188 ADA
7x Mutant Mice FP: 109 ADA
The treasury will spend ~1500 ADA (factoring for possible FP increase, and excess amount returned to treasury) to Acquire these assets. They will be long term holds as it offers us entrance into their ecosystem. 

Section 3: When will the vote for this proposal be held?
