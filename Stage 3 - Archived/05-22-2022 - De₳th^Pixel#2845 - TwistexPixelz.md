## Proposal Summary

We propose that the Boss dao launchepad will help Twisted-pixelz project with the launch and mint of there project.
We do not need any funds from the boss dao treasury!



We would like Boss dao to take a look at twisted-pixelz project.
Help with marketing to get the public in to the discord.
If there need to be some things that need to be changed help with that.
help with the minting proces and make sure it will run smooth.
We will give wl spots to the boss dao community,we also can donate some nfts to the boss dao treasury, and we have no problem if the boss dao will recive 25% of the ada that we will earn from the mint.
Also for the future plans that we have we dont mind if boss dao would keep supporting us, and get the same benefits as for the first mint!

Twisted-pixelz is a group of 3333 pixel-based army hornets! They have a mission, to protect the CNFT-community within the Cardano space.

Born out of a passion for the CNFT-space, they are here to continue fighting in one form or another.

For now, these little creatures can only be seen in low resolution, also known as pixel style. They will evolve!
 
These air troops are part of a complete army and are the first to be deployed. They clear the battlefield for their comrades.

That means a second wave of fighters must follow in order to continue the fight. Which troops will they be and what will they look like?
