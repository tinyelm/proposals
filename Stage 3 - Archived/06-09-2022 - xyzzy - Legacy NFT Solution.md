## Proposal Summary

The Boss DAO Legacy Collection has been the source of much confusion for the holders and frustration for the team. As it is no longer a governance NFT (and thereby yields no share, governance, or real "value" within Boss DAO) there has been a sharp decline in its secondary market price. In order to remove the complications the legacy NFT presents to Boss DAO, the working solution is to remove it from jpg.store as a verified listing. If consensus is achieved action should be taken immediately.

This will not forfeit aforementioned holding bonuses that you have earned for having a Legacy NFT. You will still earn $EXEC for having a Legacy NFT.
 


## Proposal Details

What will the Boss DAO do?
Remove Legacy Collection from secondary market. Only promote the sales of Boss DAO Governance Tokens. 

Why should the Boss DAO do this? 

The DAO should remove the Legacy NFT from secondary markets for 2 distinct reasons

1)
The DAO should do this because the Legacy Collection offers no further rewards than what is already announced. It is preventing new members from clearly finding & understanding the project. Doing this will allow us to on-board new members without the legacy NFT needing to be explained. Not only is this a better look for the DAO, it is easier for the mods and knowledgable members to onboard members.

2)
The Legacy Collection is inflating our supply. It seems like we have 2 seperate 4k NFT collections when really we have just one that matters. If we remove the legacy NFT from sale all volume flows -> Governance Token, which is the goal.  

This proposal will not require any resources from the DAO. If consensus is achieved, the DAO will immediately act on this and remove the Legacy NFT from secondary market listings.
