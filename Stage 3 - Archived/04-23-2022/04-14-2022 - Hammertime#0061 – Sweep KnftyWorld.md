## Proposal Summary

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the KnftyWorld floor as well as some potential rares for staking benefits. This project already provides rebates to holders and has dropped two rebates already.  At current pricing and transaction volume, ADA rebates will drop weekly.  The project is also accelerating its staking and tokenomics utility which will be used in a P2E game, also in development.  It has recently started to get noticed by the CNFT community and the floor has risen from 50ADA to 100ADA in a matter of weeks.  Now is the time to get in before it is too late. 


## Proposal Details

We propose that Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the KnftyWorld floor as well as some potential rares. With a total of 8800 NFT’s, Knfty World is relatively new, having minted and sold out on 5/6 March 2022.  This project is supported by an incredible team and a community discord of 6000 members.  The project, ranked 80 on all time volume is rapidly is rapidly attracting a cult following and had the second most transactions on jpg.store behind only Cornucopias Bubble Jet Sprinter in the month of March.

Knfty World has its own lore which was co-developed by the community although the original concept relates to the knitting of little animals by the founder’s mother-in-law.  In essence the lore relates to Knfty’s being locked up by humans and in a post-apocalyptic world, the Knfty’s have finally escaped their fortress with humans long since extinct.  They now roam Knfty World on their own.

The project team has already airdropped its first rebates to holders.  These rebates are dropped to all Knfty holders not listed on exchanges every time the community wallet hits 12,000 ADA.  The wallet is topped up by a 10% royalty on all secondary sales, 80% of which goes to the community and 20% to the dev team.  At the current transaction rate these rebates are going to be dropping weekly but as the floor rises, this may even happen every few days.  The rebate per Knfty depends on this listed on markets but amount to between 1 and 2 ADA per NFT, per drop.

Holders will also be able to stake their Knfty’s and will received daily tokens according to rank.  Tiers have been defined with rank 1 Knfty’s receiving 20 tokens per day all the way down to rank 8000’s which receive 2 tokens.

The roadmap is very succinct and this team has delivered everything it has set out to date.  The roadmap includes a Dao Governance Model, Airdrops to large holders (which would potentially include Boss Dao) as well as a game in development which is a P2E model which also tops up the community wallet.
The team is currently accelerating the development portion of the royalty portal, Knfty World lands, Humanoids (which are essentially ancient statues) and Tokenomics based on staking.

The floor on the project has been steadily rising and currently stands at 100 ADA.  We anticipate that the Dao could purchase approximately 80 Knfty Creatures off the floor or perhaps 50 creatures and some strategic rares.  The rarity of the Knfty counts towards its staking benefits, the higher the rank, the more tokens received when the staking is functional.  The rebates happen, irrespective of rarity. 

The all-time high purchase is current 4000 ADA with multiple transactions in excess of 1000 ADA.  There are currently only around 6% listed on exchanges and if the DAO invests, which says a lot about the project and the perception of its holders.

In terms of the actual NFT’s themselves, we like to say, “when in doubt, don’t zoom out zoom in”.  These little guys are based on knitted creatures and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible.  The quality of the artwork is some of the best in the CNFT space and is also very unique.  Holders just cannot stop collecting them and the more they have, the more rebates they get.

The project has grown completely organically to date with no paid promotions and massive affiliations.  It is for this reason alone that we believe this project is massively undervalued.  When it blows up more, the returns are going to be significant.  This would include both the raising of the floor price as well as the rebates and staking which would accelerate exponentially.

In summary, as with all NFT investments, the DAO is essentially acting as VC capital here becoming a shareholder of the project.  The fundamentals around this project are all sound and the fact that they have already dropped more than 38K ADA in rebates to their holders is of critical importance.  This project is delivering and the DAO should take a serious look at investing.
