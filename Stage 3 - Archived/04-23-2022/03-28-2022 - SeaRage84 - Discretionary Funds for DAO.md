Proposal Summary

I propose we allow the Opportunity Fund established with "Initial Allocation" proposal be used in a discretionary way, meaning no vote is necessary.  This would allow 
the DAO to take advantage of ripe market conditions without calling together the DAO to go through a voting process.  There will be rules put in place on the 
discretionary portion of the Treasury to make sure the DAO is protected from buying assets the DAO hasn't agreed upon.

Proposal Details
The reason this proposal is important, is as the DAO is structured now, calling for a vote everytime we see an opportunity will be difficult.  Votes are necessary but
time intensive which can result in the DAO missing out on great opportunities in the market.  In my sister proposal, "Initial Allocation Proposal", I call for the DAO
to establish an opportunity fund of roughly 20%, 25k ADA, to keep for future opportunities.  In that proposal it isn't stipulated how the funds should be used or if 
there is any discretionary component, this feels like it deserves its own vote.

The opportunity fund would be replenished over time from Capital raising (NFT mints) royalties and asset sales.

Rules the DAO team would have to stick to under this discretionary fund.
-Can only buy from projects the DAO is already invested in, ie we already have voted on the inclusion of those assets.
  - This will keep the DAO team from using funds on projects the community hasn't first voted on
-No invested asset can be more than 10% of DAO treasury
  -Exception to this will be BCRC which already has 50% of DAO assets per whitepaper
