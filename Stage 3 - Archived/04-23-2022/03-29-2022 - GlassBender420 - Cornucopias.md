What is Cornucopias?

Cornucopias is a huge play to earn, build to earn, learn to earn metaverse gaming project on Cardano expecting over a million players! They have currently launched 2 nft's
both of which are vehicals that you will be able to race and use in game, they will also be minting different kinds of land such as industrial and residental plots. Both
the bubble jet and the Javelin has shown great sales on secondary with a combined volume of around 2.7 million ADA. Desktop game is set to launch Q4 of this year and console 
is set for Q4 of next year, and a mobile mini game set to launch in Q2 of this year!


Proposal:

I propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to invest into Cornucopias metaverse project sweeping the floors of both thier Bubble Jets and their GTI Javelin, 
and mint and sweep Land(when land becomes available date to still be released).

I propose that we hold these assets until after game releases in one year and/or until furthur vote on by DAO members, Cornucopias has also stated that we will be able to
Stake the Bubble Jets and Javelins for passive income(date to still be released) but once they can be staked we stake them for passive income.
 
I propose 4000 ada spent on bubble jets, 3000 ada spent on Javelins, and 3000 will be saved for Land(mint date for land to be announced)
