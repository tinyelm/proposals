Summary: Proposal to acquire ADAPunkz Rocket Booster II for rocket completion.

I propose the DAO utilizes 3200 ADA (as currently listed) or up to 4000 ADA of the treasury fund to purchase the ADAPunkz rocket boosters II.
Purchasing the rocket boosters will allow the DAO to complete the ADA Punkz II rocket. This will double the passive earning potential of the current BCRC holdings
in the treasury. All fully assembled rocket holders along with Top 1000 Boss Cat Holders will receive 50% of the royalties of BCRC to be paid out twice a year.
First payout is rumoured to take place in July 2022. The ADA Punkz II rocket is also slightly rarer than the Cardano Blue rocket currently in the treasury 
as total amount of AdaPunkz rockets is 20 and total amount of Cardano Blue rockets is 30.Adding a 2nd rocket will also double the chances and potential earnings 
of any future airdrop where BCRP Rocket holders qualify.

Predictions on estimated added value for the DAO regarding the utility of this royalty sharing feature are very difficult at the moment as the exact implementation 
has yet to be announced and will rely heavily on Cardano network growth, Cardano price, CNFT space growing as a whole and BCRC's success as a project.

This rocket will be held indefinately or until our Boss DAO community votes yes on a proposed sale of asset.

Ideally, this vote should be done ASAP so either week 14 or 15 of 2022.

Markets are very volatile and VOX airdrop is incoming.
